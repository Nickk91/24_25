      //         Front-end development: Prototypes
      // JavaScript – Pokeman
      // The following exercise contains the following subjects:
      // ● prototypes
      // Instructions
      // You are given a function, Pokeman, that takes three
      // parameters, pokemonName, pokemonType, an array of
      // different pokemon attack methods, pokemonAttackList.

      // Here is the Pokemon function:
      function Pokemon(pokemonName, pokemonType, pokemonAttackList) {
        this.name = pokemonName;
        this.type = pokemonType;
        this.attackList = pokemonAttackList;
      }

      // 1. Create three instances of the Pokemon and save them in
      // a variable.
      let pikachu = new Pokemon("Pikachu", "Electric", [
        "Shock",
        "Kick",
        "Voltage",
      ]);
      let squirtle = new Pokemon("Squirtle", "Water", [
        "Drown",
        "Water Blast",
        "Wave",
      ]);
      let charmander = new Pokemon("Charmander", "Fire", [
        "Fry",
        "Burn",
        "Heatwave",
      ]);

      // 2. Using prototype properties, add the following methods:

      // ● A method called callPokemon will print the following:
      // “I choose you, <pokemon name>

      Pokemon.prototype.choose = function () {
        return `I choose you, ${this.name}`;
      };
      console.log(pikachu.choose());

      // ● • A method called attack that takes one parameter,
      // an attack number, that will print the specific attack
      // method from the pokemonAttackList array as the
      // following: “<pokemon name> used <attack method>”
      // Call each pokemon with the 2 methods you created.

      Pokemon.prototype.attack = function (num) {
        return ` ${this.attackList[num]}`;
      };
      console.log(pikachu.attack(0));
