      //         Front-end development:
      // JavaScript – who is stronger
      // The following exercise contains the following subjects:
      // ● bind, call, apply
      // Instructions
      // 1. What is wrong with the code? explain in your own words
      // 2. Fix the code so that invoking the whoIsStronger function
      // will print "I am stronger".
      // note: you cannot change the 'hero' or the whoIsStronger
      // function.
      const hero = {
        health: 5,
        power: 68,
        getStrength: function () {
          if (this.health <= 5) {
            return this.power - 10;
          } else return this.power;
        },
      };
      function whoIsStronger(getStrength) {
        const myStrength = 82;
        if (getStrength() < myStrength) {
          return "I am stronger";
        } else return "You are stronger";
      }
      let result = whoIsStronger(hero.getStrength.bind(hero));
      console.log(result);
    </script>
  </body>

<!-- The problem with the code is that when you invoke the
     whoIsStronger function with hero.getStrength, 
     the this context inside the getStrength method of the
      hero object is lost. This happens because getStrength
       is called as a standalone function, and within the function,
        this does not refer to the hero object. As a result,
         the comparison in whoIsStronger is not working as expected.

To fix the code and make it print "I am stronger,"
 you can use the bind method to explicitly bind the
  this context to the hero object when calling getStrength.-->
